# Connect-Four
This is my very first "big" assignment in my Springboard course. Here I focused on not only getting the Connect 4 board to be functional, but also look nice to the user.
I got to really explore the different properties and styling that CSS offers and became more comfortable with using it to style basic webpages (I even messed around with flexbox). I also got to work through where the code could be more flexible by using let and const rather than the var keyword. It helped me to understand the different rules and properties (or lack of) that each method has.

I also got some basic practice with array methods and got to parse out some logic and write it out in terms the computer can understand.

Overall, I am satisfied with my performance on this project. However, I am open to feedback and constructive criticism!
